# Dataset

Data source: Yahoo Finance provides historical stock price data that can be used for prediction models.

Features: Common features include opening price, closing price, high, low, volume, and various technical indicators.

Time series analysis: Stock prices are time-series data, so models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or Prophet can be used.

Machine learning approaches: Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines can be applied.



# SVM regression algorithm

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Description of SVM goes as follows:

Objective: SVM aims to find the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes of data points with the maximum margin.

Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, called support vectors.

Kernel trick: Allows SVM to handle non-linearly separable data by transforming the input space into a higher-dimensional feature space.
